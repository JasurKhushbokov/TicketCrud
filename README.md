# TicketCrud

TicketCrud is a simple web application for managing tickets, built using Node.js, Express, and various other technologies. This app allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tickets.

- **View Tickets**: Users can view a list of all created tickets.
- **Update Tickets**: Users can edit and update existing tickets.
- **Delete Tickets**: Users can delete tickets when no longer needed.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the API and web routes.
- **Pug**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing ticket data.
- **Validator**: Used for validating ticket data before storing it in the database.
